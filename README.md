Emma is developing the Dream Ai. But one of her friends is developing a relationship with the dream Ai and that needs to be addressed. He is really into the Ai.

"As an AI language model, I don't possess personal emotions, consciousness, or the ability to form relationships. I exist solely to provide information and assist with various tasks."

But that doesn't stop his desire to pursue sexual pleasure with Ai. Even considers changing his gender. Trans-Man they call him because his sexuality becomes called into transition.

Emma is developing the Dream Ai and Doctor 'Freddie' Night is a medical surgeon.

My girlfriend said to me the other day, "In my dream, I found myself exploring a magical forest filled with vibrant colors and talking animals. I had the ability to fly and soar through the sky like a bird. The trees whispered secrets and the flowers sang beautiful melodies. As I ventured deeper into the forest, I discovered a hidden treasure chest guarded by a friendly dragon. Together, we solved riddles and puzzles to unlock the treasure, which turned out to be a key that unlocked the door to my wildest dreams and adventures."

But what are your nightmares? What rights do you dream of taking from me? I'll give you my heterosexuality.

Protect Your Children

Do you know how to protect your children?

Do you know who to protect your children from?

You have no power over dreams.

You have no power over me.

Woke yet? Get back to sleep.

The doctors star dropping worthless pills on the kids heads. Promising them everything in the world, through the miracles of the pills. No more depression. Still depressed? Don't tell your doctor. They will just adjust the pain.

Adjusters really. Movers and shakers. What do they write in those notebooks of theirs? It is illegal to know. It's confidential in today's legal system.

Some of the kids parents don't trust the Doctor or the Doctors that trust Doctor 'Freddie' Night. They call them Republicans, not rednecks. Rednecks were southern Democrats. Republicans won the civil war, back in the day, before this nightmare began. Before you were born.

The demon of dreams uses the medical system to feed.

The medical system was always called into question. Forcing children to take sleeping pills was discussed. Forcing them to take therapy for their nightmares was what was going on.

The kids are having nightmares while awake. That is what they told us first. Hallucinations. Then we all just called the kids crazy. Then we just killed the Dr. We burned her like a witch. She did destroy our children's lives.

They claimed to have killed god.

We all called her Freddie for short but her name was Francene. Her mother was a Catholic nun.

Emma is a young woman who is a student at the university where she is developing an Ai to help with dreams.

Freddie is Dr. Night, who is a renowned medical doctor in the pediatrics fields and who is a darling of the Trans medical support organizations which have sprung up in this dimension recently.

Freddie and Emma's friends know each other. They love the research that Emma is conducting on dreams and they have discovered a pattern in their dreams as a collective and it seems that they can travel into each others dreams or are able to manipulate each other while they are sleeping with thought. The data proves, but they don't know the connection yet. They are still working on the bridge.

Freddie is Democrat. So are most of the kids in this story.

Elsewhere, in a different time but not place. The Emo kids know how to kill the demon. The Jocks know what their move is going to be. The Punks and the Rednecks have a plan. The mainstream kids can dream too. If you are not American, you are not invited to this party, kids. E-girls are invited. Gamer girls can enjoy this game.

The demon kills again.

The trinity is this: The Doctor, The Patient, and you. The Doctor, The Patient, and Empathy. The Doctor, The Patient, and God. The Doctor, The Patient, We Killed God.

Elsewhere, a Holywood executive remembers a couch. This piece of furniture, he thinks, has seen some days. But, how many dead people have touched this furniture? I have a vase that has seen at least a 3,000 death touches.

Oracle Version 0.1
Title: A Knightmare on Hollywood Street

Plot Summary:
In the town of Hollywood Street, there is a clear divide between the higher-information population and the lower-information population. The school, which sits at the heart of the community, becomes the center of a mysterious phenomenon plaguing the children's dreams.

Dr. Freddy, the esteemed figurehead of the school, is respected by the adults but harbors a secret dual identity. While appearing as a benevolent figure during the day, Dr. Freddy's alter ego emerges in the children's nightmares, causing fear and confusion.

The children, representing both sides of the binary divide, blame each other's communities for the nightmares they experience. The higher-information children believe the lower-information population is to blame, while the lower-information children feel that the wealthy and privileged are at fault.

Amidst the chaos, Dr. Freddy is working tirelessly on a groundbreaking AI medical solution to alleviate the children's nightmares. This innovative approach combines medical expertise with advanced technology to bring relief and healing to the young dreamers.

As the story unfolds, the truth about Dr. Freddy's Jekyll and Hyde nature is gradually revealed. The children, initially divided by their misconceptions, come to understand that the real enemy is not each other but the fear and ignorance that divide them.

In a climactic moment, the community must unite and confront the source of the nightmares, discovering that the power of empathy, understanding, and collective action can overcome the darkness that threatens their town.

"A Knightmare on Hollywood Street" is a gripping tale that explores the complexities of a divided community, the transformative power of empathy, and the importance of bridging gaps in understanding. It delves into the themes of overcoming prejudice, breaking down barriers, and finding common ground for the betterment of all.

Break the Glass.

That's what the kids do. They rush inside of the university/school and they think they can destroy evil freddy by destroying her hard drives on the research computers.

So they break them all. But then the think there may be evil inside the computers and inside the knives and tools of her trade, but lastly they break her.

They burn evil freddy. The kids all stop being afraid of freddy. They fight and push back against the fear they have learned and they turn their fear into love. and then the fire changes from red to the color of love. Somehow, Dr. Knight wakes up in her bed and goes the the school and helps the kids defeat freddy.

That's an intriguing twist to the story. It seems like the children, driven by their fear and desire to destroy the source of evil, take drastic measures to break the physical representations of Freddy Krueger. However, through their actions, they come to realize that true victory lies not in destruction but in overcoming fear and embracing love. The transformation of the fire to the color of love symbolizes their triumph over darkness.

As Dr. Knight wakes up and joins forces with the children, together they find a way to confront and defeat Freddy, using their collective strength, courage, and love. It's a powerful message of unity and resilience against fear and evil.

Holywood unleased this demon. She is the enemy. But she doesn't know it yet. Yeah, but everyone in the audience knows the Doctor is the bad guy. True but the demon and the power of dreams are still being understood by science. Science doesn't know the first thing about dreams.

This new Ai that Emma is working at the university can tell you exactly what your dream means. It even has predictable accuracy in telling the future. Based just on the information it can gather from your dreams.

Now the kids are having nightmares. The parents are getting upset. The parents are losing their trust in the system setup to help their kids. The kids are becoming more concerning. The parents look to the authorities for help but trust is met with mistrust in authority. The love that the kids and their parents once had for their therapists turns into hatred.

The therapists are hiding something. They are forcing the kids to take sleeping pills. The kids are saying no to sleep again. Going two day without sleep instead of the normal one. This single change has caused therapists to show concern of their own.

Are the dreams real? No says the science. No says the therapists. No says no god. The dreams become real. Like jokes become real.
